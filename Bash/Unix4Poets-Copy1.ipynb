      "19:31 And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth: 19:32 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. \r\n",
      "19:33 And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. \r\n",
      "19:34 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. \r\n",
      "19:35 And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. \r\n",
      "19:36 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father. \r\n",
      "19:37 And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day. \r\n",
      "19:38 And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day. \r\n",
      "20:1 And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar. \r\n",
      "20:2 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah. \r\n",
      "20:3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife. \r\n",
      "20:4 But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?  20:5 Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this. \r\n",
      "20:6 And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her. \r\n",
      "20:7 Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine. \r\n",
      "20:8 Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid. \r\n",
      "20:9 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done. \r\n",
      "20:10 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?  20:11 And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake. \r\n",
      "20:12 And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife. \r\n",
      "20:13 And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother. \r\n",
      "20:14 And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife. \r\n",
      "20:15 And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee. \r\n",
      "20:16 And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved. \r\n",
      "20:17 So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children. \r\n",
      "20:18 For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife. \r\n",
      "21:1 And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken. \r\n",
      "21:2 For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him. \r\n",
      "21:3 And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac. \r\n",
      "21:4 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him. \r\n",
      "21:5 And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him. \r\n",
      "21:6 And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me. \r\n",
      "21:7 And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age. \r\n",
      "21:8 And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned. \r\n",
      "21:9 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking. \r\n",
      "21:10 Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac. \r\n",
      "21:11 And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son. \r\n",
      "21:12 And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called. \r\n",
      "21:13 And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed. \r\n",
      "21:14 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba. \r\n",
      "21:15 And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs. \r\n",
      "21:16 And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept. \r\n",
      "21:17 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is. \r\n",
      "21:18 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation. \r\n",
      "21:19 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink. \r\n",
      "21:20 And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer. \r\n",
      "21:21 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt. \r\n",
      "21:22 And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest: 21:23 Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned. \r\n",
      "21:24 And Abraham said, I will swear. \r\n",
      "21:25 And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away. \r\n",
      "21:26 And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing; neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day. \r\n",
      "21:27 And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant. \r\n",
      "21:28 And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves. \r\n",
      "21:29 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?  21:30 And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well. \r\n",
      "21:31 Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they sware both of them. \r\n",
      "21:32 Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines. \r\n",
      "21:33 And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God. \r\n",
      "21:34 And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days. \r\n",
      "22:1 And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am. \r\n",
      "22:2 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of. \r\n",
      "22:3 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him. \r\n",
      "22:4 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off. \r\n",
      "22:5 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you. \r\n",
      "22:6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together. \r\n",
      "22:7 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?  22:8 And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together. \r\n",
      "22:9 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood. \r\n",
      "22:10 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. \r\n",
      "22:11 And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I. \r\n",
      "22:12 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me. \r\n",
      "22:13 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son. \r\n",
      "22:14 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen. \r\n",
      "22:15 And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time, 22:16 And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son: 22:17 That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; 22:18 And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice. \r\n",
      "22:19 So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba. \r\n",
      "22:20 And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor; 22:21 Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram, 22:22 And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel. \r\n",
      "22:23 And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother. \r\n",
      "22:24 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah. \r\n",
      "23:1 And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these were the years of the life of Sarah. \r\n",
      "23:2 And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her. \r\n",
      "23:3 And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying, 23:4 I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight. \r\n",
      "23:5 And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him, 23:6 Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead. \r\n",
      "23:7 And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth. \r\n",
      "23:8 And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar, 23:9 That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you. \r\n",
      "23:10 And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying, 23:11 Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead. \r\n",
      "23:12 And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land. \r\n",
      "23:13 And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there. \r\n",
      "23:14 And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him, 23:15 My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead. \r\n",
      "23:16 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant. \r\n",
      "23:17 And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure 23:18 Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city. \r\n",
      "23:19 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan. \r\n",
      "23:20 And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth. \r\n",
      "24:1 And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things. \r\n",
      "24:2 And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh: 24:3 And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell: 24:4 But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac. \r\n",
      "24:5 And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?  24:6 And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again. \r\n",
      "24:7 The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence. \r\n",
      "24:8 And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again. \r\n",
      "24:9 And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that matter. \r\n",
      "24:10 And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor. \r\n",
      "24:11 And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water. \r\n",
      "24:12 And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham. \r\n",
      "24:13 Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water: 24:14 And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master. \r\n",
      "24:15 And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder. \r\n",
      "24:16 And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up. \r\n",
      "24:17 And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher. \r\n",
      "24:18 And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink. \r\n",
      "24:19 And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking. \r\n",
      "24:20 And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels. \r\n",

      "24:22 And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold; 24:23 And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?  24:24 And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor. \r\n",
      "24:25 She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in. \r\n",

      "24:31 And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels. \r\n",
      "24:32 And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men's feet that were with him. \r\n",

      "26:22 And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land. \r\n",
      "26:23 And he went up from thence to Beersheba. \r\n",

      "27:11 And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man: 27:12 My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing. \r\n",
      "27:13 And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them. \r\n",

      "27:18 And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who art thou, my son?  27:19 And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first born; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me. \r\n",
      "27:20 And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it to me. \r\n",

      "29:34 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi. \r\n",
      "29:35 And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing. \r\n",
      "30:1 And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die. \r\n",
      "30:2 And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb? 30:3 And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her. \r\n",
      "30:4 And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her. \r\n",
      "30:5 And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son. \r\n",
      "30:6 And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan. \r\n",
      "30:7 And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son. \r\n",
      "30:8 And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali. \r\n",
      "30:9 When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her maid, and gave her Jacob to wife. \r\n",
      "30:10 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son. \r\n",
      "30:11 And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad. \r\n",
      "30:12 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son. \r\n",
      "30:13 And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed: and she called his name Asher. \r\n",
      "30:14 And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes. \r\n",
      "30:15 And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son's mandrakes. \r\n",
      "30:16 And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night. \r\n",
      "30:17 And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob the fifth son. \r\n",
      "30:18 And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar. \r\n",
      "30:19 And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son. \r\n",
      "30:20 And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun. \r\n",
      "30:21 And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah. \r\n",
      "30:22 And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb. \r\n",
      "30:23 And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach: 30:24 And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shall add to me another son. \r\n",
      "30:25 And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country. \r\n",
      "30:26 Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee. \r\n",
      "30:27 And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake. \r\n",
      "30:28 And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it. \r\n",
      "30:29 And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle was with me. \r\n",
      "30:30 For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?  30:31 And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep thy flock. \r\n",
      "30:32 I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire. \r\n",
      "30:33 So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me. \r\n",
      "30:34 And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word. \r\n",
      "30:35 And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons. \r\n",
      "30:36 And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks. \r\n",
      "30:37 And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods. \r\n",
      "30:38 And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink. \r\n",
      "30:39 And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted. \r\n",
      "30:40 And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban's cattle. \r\n",
      "30:41 And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods. \r\n",
      "30:42 But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's. \r\n",
      "30:43 And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses. \r\n",
      "31:1 And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all this glory. \r\n",
      "31:2 And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as before. \r\n",
      "31:3 And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee. \r\n",
      "31:4 And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock, 31:5 And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me. \r\n",
      "31:6 And ye know that with all my power I have served your father. \r\n",
      "31:7 And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me. \r\n",
      "31:8 If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked. \r\n",
      "31:9 Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me. \r\n",
      "31:10 And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled. \r\n",
      "31:11 And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I. \r\n",
      "31:12 And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee. \r\n",
      "31:13 I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred. \r\n",
      "31:14 And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?  31:15 Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money. \r\n",
      "31:16 For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do. \r\n",
      "31:17 Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels; 31:18 And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan. \r\n",
      "31:19 And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's. \r\n",
      "31:20 And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled. \r\n",
      "31:21 So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead. \r\n",
      "31:22 And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled. \r\n",
      "31:23 And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead. \r\n",
      "31:24 And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad. \r\n",
      "31:25 Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead. \r\n",
      "31:26 And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword?  31:27 Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp? 31:28 And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing. \r\n",
      "31:29 It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad. \r\n",
      "31:30 And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?  31:31 And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me. \r\n",
      "31:32 With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them. \r\n",
      "31:33 And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent. \r\n",
      "31:34 Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not. \r\n",
      "31:35 And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched but found not the images. \r\n",
      "31:36 And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?  31:37 Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both. \r\n",
      "31:38 This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten. \r\n",
      "31:39 That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night. \r\n",
      "31:40 Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes. \r\n",
      "31:41 Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times. \r\n",
      "31:42 Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight. \r\n",
      "31:43 And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born? 31:44 Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee. \r\n",
      "31:45 And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar. \r\n",
      "31:46 And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap. \r\n",
      "31:47 And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed. \r\n",
      "31:48 And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed; 31:49 And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another. \r\n",
      "31:50 If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee. \r\n",
      "31:51 And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee: 31:52 This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm. \r\n",
      "31:53 The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac. \r\n",
      "31:54 Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount. \r\n",
      "31:55 And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place. \r\n",
      "32:1 And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him. \r\n",
      "32:2 And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim. \r\n",
      "32:3 And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom. \r\n",
      "32:4 And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now: 32:5 And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight. \r\n",
      "32:6 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him. \r\n",
      "32:7 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands; 32:8 And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape. \r\n",
      "32:9 And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee: 32:10 I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands. \r\n",
      "32:11 Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children. \r\n",
      "32:12 And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude. \r\n",
      "32:13 And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother; 32:14 Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams, 32:15 Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals. \r\n",
      "32:16 And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove. \r\n",
      "32:17 And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?  32:18 Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us. \r\n",
      "32:19 And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him. \r\n",
      "32:20 And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me. \r\n",
      "32:21 So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company. \r\n",
      "32:22 And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok. \r\n",
      "32:23 And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had. \r\n",
      "32:24 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day. \r\n",
      "32:25 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him. \r\n",
      "32:26 And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me. \r\n",
      "32:27 And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob. \r\n",
      "32:28 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed. \r\n",
      "32:29 And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there. \r\n",
      "32:30 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved. \r\n",
      "32:31 And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh. \r\n",
      "32:32 Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank. \r\n",
      "33:1 And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids. \r\n",
      "33:2 And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost. \r\n",
      "33:3 And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother. \r\n",
      "33:4 And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept. \r\n",
      "33:5 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given thy servant. \r\n",
      "33:6 Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves. \r\n",
      "33:7 And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves. \r\n",
      "33:8 And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord. \r\n",
      "33:9 And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself. \r\n",
      "33:10 And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me. \r\n",
      "33:11 Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it. \r\n",
      "33:12 And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee. \r\n",
      "33:13 And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die. \r\n",
      "33:14 Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir. \r\n",
      "33:15 And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord. \r\n",
      "33:16 So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir. \r\n",
      "33:17 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth. \r\n",
      "33:18 And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent before the city. \r\n",
      "33:19 And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money. \r\n",
      "33:20 And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael. \r\n",
      "34:1 And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land. \r\n",
      "34:2 And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her. \r\n",
      "34:3 And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel. \r\n",
      "34:4 And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife. \r\n",
      "34:5 And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come. \r\n",
      "34:6 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him. \r\n",
      "34:7 And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter: which thing ought not to be done. \r\n",
      "34:8 And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife. \r\n",
      "34:9 And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you. \r\n",
      "34:10 And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein. \r\n",
      "34:11 And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give. \r\n",
      "34:12 Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife. \r\n",
      "34:13 And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister: 34:14 And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us: 34:15 But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be, that every male of you be circumcised; 34:16 Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people. \r\n",
      "34:17 But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone. \r\n",
      "34:18 And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son. \r\n",

      "39:22 And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it. \r\n",
      "39:23 The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the LORD made it to prosper. \r\n",
      "40:1 And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt. \r\n",
      "40:2 And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers. \r\n",
      "40:3 And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound. \r\n",
      "40:4 And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in ward. \r\n",
      "40:5 And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the prison. \r\n",
      "40:6 And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they were sad. \r\n",
      "40:7 And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day?  40:8 And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you. \r\n",
      "40:9 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me; 40:10 And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes: 40:11 And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand. \r\n",
      "40:12 And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days: 40:13 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler. \r\n",
      "40:14 But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house: 40:15 For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon. \r\n",
      "40:16 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head: 40:17 And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head. \r\n",
      "40:18 And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days: 40:19 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee. \r\n",
      "40:20 And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants. \r\n",
      "40:21 And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand: 40:22 But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them. \r\n",
      "40:23 Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him. \r\n",
      "41:1 And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river. \r\n",
      "41:2 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow. \r\n",
      "41:3 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river. \r\n",
      "41:4 And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke. \r\n",
      "41:5 And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good. \r\n",
      "41:6 And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them. \r\n",
      "41:7 And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream. \r\n",
      "41:8 And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh. \r\n",
      "41:9 Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day: 41:10 Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker: 41:11 And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream. \r\n",
      "41:12 And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret. \r\n",
      "41:13 And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged. \r\n",
      "41:14 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh. \r\n",
      "41:15 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it. \r\n",
      "41:16 And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace. \r\n",
      "41:17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river: 41:18 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow: 41:19 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness: 41:20 And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine: 41:21 And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke. \r\n",
      "41:22 And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good: 41:23 And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them: 41:24 And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me. \r\n",
      "41:25 And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do. \r\n",
      "41:26 The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one. \r\n",
      "41:27 And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine. \r\n",
      "41:28 This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh. \r\n",
      "41:29 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt: 41:30 And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land; 41:31 And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall be very grievous. \r\n",
      "41:32 And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass. \r\n",
      "41:33 Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt. \r\n",
      "41:34 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years. \r\n",
      "41:35 And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities. \r\n",
      "41:36 And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine. \r\n",
      "41:37 And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants. \r\n",
      "41:38 And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?  41:39 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art: 41:40 Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou. \r\n",
      "41:41 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt. \r\n",
      "41:42 And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck; 41:43 And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt. \r\n",
      "41:44 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt. \r\n",
      "41:45 And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt. \r\n",
      "41:46 And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt. \r\n",
      "41:47 And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls. \r\n",
      "41:48 And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same. \r\n",
      "41:49 And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number. \r\n",
      "41:50 And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him. \r\n",
      "41:51 And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house. \r\n",
      "41:52 And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction. \r\n",
      "41:53 And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended. \r\n",
      "41:54 And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. \r\n",
      "41:55 And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do. \r\n",
      "41:56 And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt. \r\n",
      "41:57 And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because that the famine was so sore in all lands. \r\n",
      "42:1 Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?  42:2 And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die. \r\n",
      "42:3 And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt. \r\n",
      "42:4 But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him. \r\n",
      "42:5 And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan. \r\n",
      "42:6 And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth. \r\n",
      "42:7 And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food. \r\n",
      "42:8 And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him. \r\n",
      "42:9 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come. \r\n",
      "42:10 And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come. \r\n",
      "42:11 We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies. \r\n",
      "42:12 And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come. \r\n",
      "42:13 And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not. \r\n",
      "42:14 And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies: 42:15 Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither. \r\n",
      "42:16 Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies. \r\n",
      "42:17 And he put them all together into ward three days. \r\n",
      "42:18 And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God: 42:19 If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses: 42:20 But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so. \r\n",
      "42:21 And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us. \r\n",
      "42:22 And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required. \r\n",
      "42:23 And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto them by an interpreter. \r\n",
      "42:24 And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes. \r\n",
      "42:25 Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them. \r\n",
      "42:26 And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence. \r\n",
      "42:27 And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth. \r\n",
      "42:28 And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us?  42:29 And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying, 42:30 The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country. \r\n",
      "42:31 And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies: 42:32 We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan. \r\n",
      "42:33 And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone: 42:34 And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land. \r\n",
      "42:35 And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid. \r\n",
      "42:36 And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me. \r\n",
      "42:37 And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again. \r\n",
      "42:38 And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave. \r\n",
      "43:1 And the famine was sore in the land. \r\n",
      "43:2 And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food. \r\n",
      "43:3 And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you. \r\n",
      "43:4 If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food: 43:5 But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you. \r\n",
      "43:6 And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?  43:7 And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?  43:8 And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones. \r\n",
      "43:9 I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever: 43:10 For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time. \r\n",
      "43:11 And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds: 43:12 And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight: 43:13 Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man: 43:14 And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved. \r\n",
      "43:15 And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph. \r\n",
      "43:16 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these men shall dine with me at noon. \r\n",
      "43:17 And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house. \r\n",
      "43:18 And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses. \r\n",
      "43:19 And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the house, 43:20 And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food: 43:21 And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand. \r\n",
      "43:22 And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks. \r\n",
      "43:23 And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them. \r\n",
      "43:24 And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender. \r\n",
      "43:25 And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there. \r\n",
      "43:26 And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth. \r\n",
      "43:27 And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?  43:28 And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance. \r\n",
      "43:29 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son. \r\n",
      "43:30 And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there. \r\n",
      "43:31 And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread. \r\n",
      "43:32 And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians. \r\n",
      "43:33 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another. \r\n",
      "43:34 And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of their's. And they drank, and were merry with him. \r\n",
      "44:1 And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth. \r\n",
      "44:2 And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken. \r\n",
      "44:3 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses. \r\n",
      "44:4 And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?  44:5 Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing. \r\n",
      "44:6 And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words. \r\n",
      "44:7 And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing: 44:8 Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?  44:9 With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen. \r\n",
      "44:10 And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless. \r\n",
      "44:11 Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack. \r\n",
      "44:12 And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack. \r\n",
      "44:13 Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city. \r\n",
      "44:14 And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground. \r\n",
      "44:15 And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?  44:16 And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak?  or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found. \r\n",
      "44:17 And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father. \r\n",
      "44:18 Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh. \r\n",
      "44:19 My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?  44:20 And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him. \r\n",
      "44:21 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him. \r\n",

      "48:8 And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?  48:9 And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them. \r\n",

      "50:11 And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan. \r\n",
      "50:12 And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them: 50:13 For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre. \r\n",
      "50:14 And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father. \r\n",
      "50:15 And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him. \r\n",
      "50:16 And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying, 50:17 So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him. \r\n",
      "50:18 And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be thy servants. \r\n",
      "50:19 And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?  50:20 But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive. \r\n",
      "50:21 Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them. \r\n",
      "50:22 And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years. \r\n",
      "50:23 And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph's knees. \r\n",
      "50:24 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. \r\n",
      "50:25 And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence. \r\n",
      "50:26 So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt. \r\n"
